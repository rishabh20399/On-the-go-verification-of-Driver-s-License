Typically, and currently, a police officer looks at the physical driver’s  license card and simply assumes that the license, together with the information it contains, was issued  by the “transport authority”, and none else. 
Given that it is not difficult to copy, alter or produce afresh  a plastic card, how can one use technology to verify on the go a driver license card, when shown to a  police officer on the road or elsewhere. 
(Principle: Today cellular based access to Internet-connected servers from smart cell phones is readily available, in almost all parts of India)  

Questions addressed:  
1. What is the information to be supplied by the driver to the police officer? And what information  is sought and obtained by the police officer from the server in the transport authority?  
2. Would you need a central server that has the correct and complete information on all drivers  and the licenses issued to them?  
3. In what way are digital signatures relevant?  
4. Does one need to ensure that information is kept confidential? Or not altered during 2-way communication?  
5. Which of these, viz. confidentiality, authentication, integrity and non-repudiation is/are relevant?  
6. Is date and time of communication important? If so how can  that be obtained from a well-known server in a secure manner?
